              <p>Hi! I'm Bianca and I would love to tell you a bit about my self and 
                this project ... I was borned and raised in Argentina.
                I'm a professional cook and I've been doing that for the past 10 years.
                On 2016 I opened my own restaurant. It was such a great experience building
                that project, but two years later it had to come to an end.</p>
          
              <h3>Migrating to a new country looking for new opportunities</h3>

              <p>Leaving my restaurant was devastating and I had no idea what to do next.
                So I decided to join a friend on her trip to Barcelona. We decided to let
                things flow and see what happened.</p>
              <p>I got a job at this great cultural cafe as a cook. I made friends, I learned 
                to speak Catalan, I travelled a lot. And then the virus came. That's when I tripped over
                my reality. I knew I had to change careers, because I was already very tired of 
                working as a cook and I wasn't enjoying it anymore. To be honest I never imagined I would
                get sick of my profession. But it happened.</p>

              <h3>New beginnings</h3>

              <p>I started an active search of what would be my new career. I tried many things, 
                did many courses, went to many schools and talked to a lot of people. But the only 
                thing that really caught my attention, was coding. My boyfriend lightly suggested it
                and I'm so greatfull for that, because I can't believe how much I'm enjoying it!</p>

              <p>I've been studying and doing courses for the past three months and it's amazing how
                much I've learned so far and how hungry I am for more.</p>

              <p>Allow me to finish this presentation about me just explaining very quickly something 
                about this web. I see this project as a 'goodbye' to cooking professionaly and as a 
                'hello' to coding. I'll try to leave all my recipes here. Recipes I love and I've made 
                so many times. Some of them are from my grandma, some others from my mom and the rest 
                of them are experiments, restaurant anecdotes, friends sharing. I just hope you can enjoy
                them as much as I do!</p>
