##A website about me and food.

###About Coccobello

I did this small project in order to submit it to Migracode as an admission test for the Web Developer course. I was asked to build a website about a hobby or something I like with basic knowlegde of HTML and CSS.

It's my first project and I'm quite proud of it. I used all the tools that I had to build it and I also learned some new skills in the process of building it. I really like the buttons that I included, but I feel like I really could improve the small animation on them.

This is a starting point and I hope I can get much better in my next projects.

###Something you don't know

The recipes in the website are really good and I highly recommend you to try them.
